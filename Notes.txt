unordered_map 
    in average and best case i will be O(1) very rare worst case O(n)
    once in a blue moon collation will happen as the hashing happens from last digit of the number
    only primary variables like string, int, char are allowed
    sometimes falls in time exceed error then moveon with map 

map 
    O(log n) always
    stores the value in a order from


map.first // to get the key
map.second // to get the values

size(map) // for getting size
